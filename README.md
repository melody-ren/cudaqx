# Welcome to the CUDA-QX repository

This repository contains a set of libraries that build on
NVIDIA CUDA-Q. These libraries enable the rapid development of hybrid quantum-classical
application code leveraging state-of-the-art CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs.

## Getting Started

To learn more about how to work with the CUDA-QX libraries, please take a look at the
[CUDA-QX Documentation][cudaqx_docs]. The page contains detailed
[installation instructions][official_install] for officially released packages.

## Looking for CUDA-Q Solvers?

The CUDA-Q Solvers library has been removed from this repository; version 0.6.0
was its final planned release. Development continues in
[CUDA-Q Algorithms][cudaq_algorithms_github], which supersedes CUDA-Q Solvers
and expands on it:

```bash
pip install cudaq-algorithms
```

See the [CUDA-Q Algorithms documentation][cudaq_algorithms_docs] for tutorials
and examples, [cudaq-algorithms on PyPI][cudaq_algorithms_pypi] for the package,
and [NVIDIA/cudaq-algorithms on GitHub][cudaq_algorithms_github] for the source
code. The CUDA-Q QEC library continues to be developed in this repository.
