CUDA-QX - The CUDA-Q Libraries Collection
==========================================

CUDA-QX is a collection of libraries that build upon the CUDA-Q programming model
to enable the rapid development of hybrid quantum-classical application code leveraging
state-of-the-art CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs. It provides C++ libraries and Python
packages that enable research, development, and application creation for use
cases in quantum error correction.

.. note::

   **CUDA-Q QEC is actively developed and fully supported.** The deprecation
   notice below applies *only* to the CUDA-Q Solvers library; it does not
   affect CUDA-Q QEC, which continues to receive new features, performance
   improvements, and releases.

.. attention::

   **CUDA-Q Solvers is deprecated (this does not affect CUDA-Q QEC).**
   Version 0.6.0 is the final planned
   release of the CUDA-Q Solvers library. Development continues in **CUDA-Q
   Algorithms**, which supersedes CUDA-Q Solvers and expands on it. Install it
   with :code:`pip install cudaq-algorithms`
   (`cudaq-algorithms on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/cudaq-algorithms/>`__),
   read the `CUDA-Q Algorithms documentation
   <https://nvidia.github.io/cudaq-algorithms/>`__, and find the source code at
   `NVIDIA/cudaq-algorithms on GitHub <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cudaq-algorithms>`__.
